## Uber Ride Analytics Dashboard | Power BI

### Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze Uber ride data and evaluate key business and operational metrics.
The objective of this analysis is to transform raw ride-level data into actionable insights that can help stakeholders understand booking performance, revenue trends, ride efficiency, and customer experience.

#### The dashboard is designed with a business-first approach, focusing on clarity, usability, and decision-making support.

### Business Problem
Ride-hailing platforms like Uber generate large volumes of operational data. However, without effective visualization, it becomes difficult to answer critical business questions such as:
How many bookings are successfully completed vs lost?
How is revenue distributed across vehicle types?
What are the demand trends across months?
Which locations generate the highest pickups and drop-offs?
How do customer and driver ratings reflect service quality?
This dashboard addresses these questions through well-structured KPIs and visual storytelling.

### Key Metrics Analyzed
The dashboard tracks the following core metrics:
Completed Bookings: 93K
Lost Bookings: 57K
Total Revenue: 52M
Total Distance Travelled: 2.51M
Average Ride Distance: 24.64

### Additional performance indicators include:
Booking status distribution (Completed, Cancelled, Incomplete)
Revenue trends by month
Revenue contribution by vehicle type
Top pickup and drop locations
Average customer and driver ratings
Dashboard Features & Visualizations

### The Power BI dashboard includes:
KPI Cards for high-level performance tracking
Area Chart showing completed booking trends by month and quarter
Bar Charts for monthly revenue analysis
Vehicle-Type Revenue Comparison to identify high-performing categories
Donut Charts representing booking outcomes
Location Analysis highlighting top pickup and drop zone
Interactive Slicers for vehicle type and time period filtering
The dashboard is fully interactive, allowing users to drill down into specific dimensions and compare trends dynamically.
Tools & Technologies Used

### Power BI: Data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard development
Power Query: Data cleaning and transformation
DAX: Creation of calculated measures and KPIs
Data Visualization Principles: Focus on readability, consistency, and business relevance
Data Preparation & Modeling
Imported raw ride data into Power BI
Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query
Created calculated measures for revenue, distance, averages, and booking counts
Designed a logical data model to support efficient filtering and aggregation
Applied formatting and layout techniques to improve visual clarity and usability

### Key Insights
A significant portion of bookings are lost, indicating potential optimization areas in ride availability or pricing
Revenue remains relatively consistent across months with minor seasonal variation
Certain vehicle types contribute disproportionately higher revenue
Specific locations dominate pickup and drop activity, highlighting demand hotspots
Customer and driver ratings indicate overall service quality but leave room for improvement
